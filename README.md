# **ServiceDeskLite**

This project is a **mini version of a service desk tool**, designed to make it easier to submit requests and display basic info about them right on your own website.

### **Features**
- **Easy Integration:** Just embed it on your website using an iframe to show service desk details.
- **Quick Requests:** Submit new requests or get updates on your current ones.
- **Uses the Service Desk API:** Works through the official Service Desk API to fetch and send data securely.

### **How It Works**
`Miniature Service Desk` connects to your service desk through the API, so you can:
- **Send in new requests** directly from your site.
- **Check on active requests** to see what's happening.

If youâ€™re looking for a simple way to keep track of requests or let people submit them from your site, this project might be a good fit.
